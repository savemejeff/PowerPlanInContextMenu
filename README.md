This registry script is for adding a option to Windows context menu, to make switch power plan easily.

The code is mainly from this site:

> [Add or Remove "Choose Power Plan" context menu in Windows 11](https://www.elevenforum.com/t/add-or-remove-choose-power-plan-context-menu-in-windows-11.2459/)

I changed some params to make it works on my computer, and also translate the option to Chinese.

## How to use:

Run 'add_power_plans.reg' to add context menu options or run 'remvoe_power_plans.reg' to remove.
